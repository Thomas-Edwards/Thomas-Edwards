### Hello!

I am a computer science and mathematics major at the University of Maryland, College Park. Below are some of my most recent projects:

## [The Incident of Day 425](https://github.com/Calvin-Davis/CMSC425_FinalProject_Team8) (Unity Game)
The Incident of Day 425 is a puzzle platformer made in Unity where you run, jump, and invert gravity to escape evil robots (roguebots)!

## [MazeViz](https://github.com/Thomas-Edwards/MazeViz)
I just finished a maze generator/solver visual called [MazeViz](https://github.com/Thomas-Edwards/MazeViz)! It is a tool to visualize in real time how various algorithms can be used to randomly generate and solve simple mazes. Below is a picture a maze being solved using the A* algorithm
